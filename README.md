# What Season?

This is a simple implementation of a react app, to discover the current weather, based on your location.

It runs on [Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js) with help from [Tailwind.css](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/examples/cards) to make it pretty :nail_care:

The app will fetch a random image from [Unsplash](http://unsplash.com) that may represent your current season.

## Backend

All logic is handled on [What Season API](https://github.com/pedrolucasp/what-season-api).
